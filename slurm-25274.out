/ailab/user/dailinrui/.conda/envs/ldm/lib/python3.11/site-packages/torch/_utils.py:831: UserWarning: TypedStorage is deprecated. It will be removed in the future and UntypedStorage will be the only storage class. This should only matter to you if you are using storages directly.  To access UntypedStorage directly, use tensor.untyped_storage() instead of tensor.storage()

Some weights of ErnieModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /ailab/user/dailinrui/data/dependency/bert-ernie-health and are newly initialized: ['ernie.pooler.dense.bias', 'ernie.pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
